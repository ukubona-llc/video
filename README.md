### 🔤 Etymology:

* **Latin**: *videō, vidēre, vīdī, vīsum* → *to see*

  * 1st person present: **videō** → *I see*
* **Italian**: inherited many words from Latin, but "video" is a **modern borrowing** (from English) used in media/tech contexts.

### 📽️ Italian Usage:

In Italian, **"video"** is now used just like in English, especially for:

* *un video su YouTube* – a video on YouTube
* *guardare un video* – to watch a video

But it's not a traditional Italian verb like *vedere* or *guardare*.

### 🤔 So what *is* the native Italian verb for "to see"?

* **Vedere** – to see

  * e.g., *vedo* = I see
* **Guardare** – to look/watch

  * e.g., *guardo un film* = I watch a movie

### 🧠 Bonus: Video as a Philosophical Statement

Because **video** literally means *"I see"* in Latin, it's perfect for:

* **recursive systems** (*I see myself seeing*)
* **epistemological metaphors** (*video ergo sum* – I see, therefore I am)
* **Ukubona's cinematic illusion framework**
